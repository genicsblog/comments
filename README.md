## Comments at genicsblog.com

This repository hosts the comments at [genicsblog.com](https://genicsblog.com).

Previously we used a self-hosted [Staticman](https://staticman.net) API instance and the [main repository](https://github.com/genicsblog/genicsblog.com) retreived these comments at workflow runtime to include them to the generated static site.

Now, the setup has been moved to [giscus](https://giscus.app) and uses [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/genicsblog/comments/discussions) to host the comments.
